    "In this exercise you will practice working with videos, and simple segmentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your zip file should include the following files only:\n",
    "    - ex2-driver.ipynb  **Or**  ex2-driver.py \n",
    "    - ex2_ID_ID.doc  **Or**  ex2_ID_ID.pdf\n",
    "2. The results you are asked to display and the open questions should be answered in a doc/pdf file. \n",
    "   (Don't add the python code to that file.)\n",
    "4. You may use any IDE  (e.g., Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, Pycharm, ect.).\n",
    "5. Name the file 'ex2_ID_ID.zip' and do **not** include any additional directories. \n",
    "6. Submit using *moodle*\n",
    "7. Submit on time!\n",
    "8. You can submit this assignment in pairs (no triples).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "1. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Do not submit your tests, unless requested.\n",
    "3. Use `python 3` and `numpy 1.18.5`. Changes of the configuration we provided are at your own risk. Before submitting the exercise, restart the kernel and run the notebook from start to finish to make sure everything works.\n",
    "4. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only. Any other imports are forbidden, unless been provided by us.\n",
    "4. Your code must run without errors. Note,  **code that fails to  run will not be graded.**\n",
    "5. Document your code properly.\n",
    "6. **Note:** you are given a set of videos, you are welcome to use them or any other videos. If they are too long, you can use only part of the frames. If they are too large, you can rescale them.\n",
    "7. In case there  are several possible variations for implementing the algorithms - make your own  choice, and give a short explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Honor Code:\n",
    "The assignment is a basic tool for learning the material. You can probably find the solution on the Web. However, if  you do so, then you will not learn what you should learn from it. In addition, since we  grade  the assignment, using existing solutions will be considered dishonest.\n",
    "In particular, you are not allowed to copy or use any code that solves the task. \n",
    "You are more than welcome to talk with your friends, but you are not allowed to give your code or answers and you are not allowed to use their code or answers. \n",
    "Remember – you take this course in order to learn.\n"
