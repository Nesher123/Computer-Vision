GRADE: 96

The project addresses the task of counting the number of cars passing through a certain location, manually (and also automatic) detection of parking spots in a parking lot, and determine whether a spot is occupied or empty.
Automatic detection of the parking spots is performed using Canny edge detector and Hough transform. Then many variants of a change detection algorithm were tested.
The evaluation is performed on a single frame on video downloaded from the WEB.
In addition,  new data was also collected. The evaluation was limited to a single frame.

It is impossible to follow the video presentation, in particular, the video is not supposed to go over the code.
Some details are missing in the document in order to understand the project.
In particular, for some of the presented results, there is no explanation about what are the methods used and no details are given on the cars counting method.
However, the students present a good understanding of their project during the meeting.
